This application uses react router 5.2 and a db.json server file to create a simple web application which can be used to store cooking recipes. 

It uses a custom fetch hook to fetch data from the local json server and post it there also. 

The application has a search functionality to handle recipe searchers, a create recipe functionality where any user can add their own recipe. 

The recipes are displayed as condensed cards which can then be expanded. 

React context, which is used as a custom hook, together with useReducer is used to create a dark theme mode, toggle between light and dark mode added and navbar theme color selector added. 

Updated version with react router 6 to follow once this project is completed.
