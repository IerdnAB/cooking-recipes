This application uses react router 5.2 and a db.json server file to create a simple web application which can be used to store cooking recipes. 

It uses a custome fetch hook to fetch data from the local json server and post it there also. 

The application has a search functionality to handle recipe searchers, a create recipe functionality where any user can add their own recipe. 

The recipes are displayed as condensed cards which can then be expanded.
